I created this tool to extract stuff from one or more ccts files.
You can configure the settings.ini to extract all ccts from a folder.

Feel free to edit or improve my code as long you keep the credits.

## This tool can extract:
* Images
* Sounds
* Fields
* Text
* Script (Only unprotected files)

## This tool uses the extras below:
* Core xtras from Director MX 2004
* FileIO
* FileXtra4 by Kent Kersten > http://www.kblab.net/xtras
* ImgXtra by Valentin Schmidt > https://valentin.dasdeck.com/xtras/img_xtra/
* MP3Xtra by Valentin Schmidt > https://valentin.dasdeck.com/xtras/mp3_xtra/

## How can i edit the source?
* You need **Macromedia Director MX 2004** to open the .dir file.
* You need to copy all xtras content to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Xtras**
